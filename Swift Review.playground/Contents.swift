//1. Declare a variable named color of type String, use type annotation.


//2. Assign the value of "purple" to color


//3. Change the value to "red"


//4. Declare a constant named font of type String, use type annotation.


//5. Assign the value of "Helvetica" to font


//6. Change the value to "Arial"


/*
What's the difference between var and let?
How would this exercise look if you used type inference instead of type annotation?
*/


// -----------------

//1. Write a function that takes in a color (String) and prints out "My favorite color is _____"


//2. Call your function


//3. Write a function that takes in a color (String) and returns "My favorite color is _____"


//4. Call the function, can you see the result?

//5. Write a function that takes in a color (String) and a name (String) and returns "_____'s favorite color is _____"

/*
Did you use internal and external parameter names? If not, try it :)
*/


// ------------------------

// --------------------------

//Declare a variable called "color" of type optional String


//What values can color store?
//color = "lilac"


//How would you print out the value of "color"?


/*
Review:
- force unwrapping
- optional binding
- guard
*/


// ------------------------

//1. Define an array called "fruits" and add fruit names.


//2. Print how many elements are stored in the array


//3. Print the second element in the array


//4. Remove the first element in the array


//5. Add another element to the array


//6. Empty array


/*
Look into:
- Creating an empty array
- Built in methods (like sort)
